#  Deep CNN model for Cifar-10 classification
This is a solution for the CIFAR-10 image classification problem using the LeNet-5 and VGG-16 models. The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. The images are preprocessed and scaled from [0,255] to [0,1]. The labels are one-hot encoded for the model training. 

The LeNet-5 model is constructed with a SGD optimizer, a categorical crossentropy loss function, and an accuracy metric. The model consists of two convolutional layers, two maxpooling layers, three fully connected layers, and a softmax output layer. The model is trained with a batch size of 1024 and 100 epochs.

The VGG-16 model is constructed with a SGD optimizer, a categorical crossentropy loss function, and an accuracy metric. The model consists of four convolutional layers, four maxpooling layers, two fully connected layers, and a softmax output layer. The model is trained with a batch size of 1024 and 100 epochs.
